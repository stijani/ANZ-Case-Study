    "- **State:** The number of reported flu cases within the period in this data were highly influenced by state, with QLD and NSW playing dominant roles. We can conclude that State is a driver for flu in Australia\n",
    "- **Age:** The age groups `00-04` and `05-09` contributed most of the flus cases within the reviewed period. Therefore, age is a driver for flu in Australia for this period. \n",
    "- **Sex:** The dominance classes in Sex are Male and Female. As shown in the A/B test above, there's no statical difference in the distrubtion of these two classes over the period in review. Therefore we can say that Sex is not a driver flu.\n",
    "- **Indegenous Status:** Majority of the cases either do not have Indegenous Status reported or were not know. Therefore we cannot determine with the current data if indegous status is a driver for flu in Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PS:** The conclusions and overall analysis are limited to the period of Jan. 2008 and Jan. 2018"
